Layered Lighting is a project of building a DMX control sofware open and free.

Open: the software is built with modules as process in mind. Communication is based
on protocols and unix sockets (ip sockets are not a target, but nothing is designed
aginst using it)

Free: as in a speech, the software is covered by GPLv3
Free: as in a beer, nothing has to be paid for using the
software.



Repository layout :
    - drivers : all the stuff that will speak to devices. Generally, these
        are process that will read and write data on their stdin/stdout.
    - merger : a tool enabling the core of the soft : it merges different
        layers of lighting data into one, or more DMX univers. There is
        no limit on the count of DMX univers you can manage, aside hardware
        limits.
    - tools : all the UI that will enable you to control your lights (faders,
        timers, buttons, pan/tilt control, color choosing, etc)
